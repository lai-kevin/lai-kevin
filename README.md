## ðŸš€ Projects
1. **[Decentralized File Sharing Network](https://github.com/lai-kevin/Forum-Microservice](https://github.com/lai-kevin/OrcaNet-Tuna):** A decentralized file sharing networks enabling secure P2P file transfer. Simply search a file by its hash to view providers of the file. Providers earn cryptocurrency from transactions with downloaders. This project features nodes that can be used as proxies, allowing users with restricted internet access to reroute their internet traffic to other devices.

2. **[Milton: Scan Art with ML](https://github.com/orgs/Milton-Art-Scan/repositories):** An app that makes art galleries interactive, where you can get context/education information from artists by scanning.

3. **[STARS: Stony Brook Assembler and Runtime Simulator](https://github.com/sbustars/STARS):** Worked alongside Professor McDonnell and Professor Mitra at Stony Brook University to develop STARS, a Python program that parses and emulates MIPS assembly execution.
   
4. **[Malloc!](https://github.com/lai-kevin/Memory-Allocator):** A x86-64 dynamic memory allocator written in C. Completed as a university project. Utilizes segregated free lists and "quick lists" to improve time complexity. Immediately coalesces large blocks with adjacent free blocks on free, splits without splinters, and omits block footer to improve space efficiency.

5. **[RaceTree](https://github.com/lai-kevin/RaceTree-Production):** A full-stack web application built for sim-racing professionals and hobbyists. RaceTree focuses on providing 3 key features: profile pages, a platform stewarding user uploaded youtube clips with a publicly accessible API, and an Esport
Driver Registry API for users with a RaceTree account.

6. **[Forum Microservice](https://github.com/lai-kevin/Forum-Microservice):** A containerized forum microservice that powers Reddit-style discussions with voting, user profiles, scalability, and an API. Users can register, login, and perform various actions such as creating posts, commenting, and voting on posts.
