## ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some projects I'm proud of:

1. **[STARS: Stony Brook Assembler and Runtime Simulator](https://github.com/sbustars/STARS):** Worked alongside Professor McDonnell and Professor Mitra at Stony Brook University to develop STARS, a Python program that parses and emulates MIPS assembly execution.
2. **[Malloc!](https://github.com/lai-kevin/Memory-Allocator):** A x86-64 dynamic memory allocator written in C. Completed as a university project. Utilizes segregated free lists and "quick lists" to improve time complexity. Immediately coalesces large blocks with adjacent free blocks on free, splits without splinters, and omits block footer to improve space efficiency.
3. **[RaceTree](https://github.com/lai-kevin/RaceTree-Production):** A full-stack web application built for sim-racing professionals and hobbyists. RaceTree focuses on providing 3 key features:
verified profile pages, a crowdsourced stewarding platform for user uploaded clips with a publicly accessible API, and an Esport
Driver Registry API. Providing sim-racing communities a solution for looking up driving records of registered RaceTree and
Steam users.
4. **[Forum Microservice](https://github.com/lai-kevin/Forum-Microservice):** A containerized forum microservice that powers Reddit-style discussions with voting, user profiles, scalability, and an API. Users can register, login, and perform various actions such as creating posts, commenting, and voting on posts.
