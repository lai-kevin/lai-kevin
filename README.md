## ðŸš€ Projects
1. **[Milton: Scan Art with ML](https://github.com/orgs/Milton-Art-Scan/repositories):** An app that makes art galleries interactive, where you can get context/education information from artists by scanning.

2. **[STARS: Stony Brook Assembler and Runtime Simulator](https://github.com/sbustars/STARS):** Worked alongside Professor McDonnell and Professor Mitra at Stony Brook University to develop STARS, a Python program that parses and emulates MIPS assembly execution.
3. **[Malloc!](https://github.com/lai-kevin/Memory-Allocator):** A x86-64 dynamic memory allocator written in C. Completed as a university project. Utilizes segregated free lists and "quick lists" to improve time complexity. Immediately coalesces large blocks with adjacent free blocks on free, splits without splinters, and omits block footer to improve space efficiency.
4. **[RaceTree](https://github.com/lai-kevin/RaceTree-Production):** A full-stack web application built for sim-racing professionals and hobbyists. RaceTree focuses on providing 3 key features: profile pages, a platform stewarding user uploaded youtube clips with a publicly accessible API, and an Esport
Driver Registry API for users with a RaceTree account.
5. **[Forum Microservice](https://github.com/lai-kevin/Forum-Microservice):** A containerized forum microservice that powers Reddit-style discussions with voting, user profiles, scalability, and an API. Users can register, login, and perform various actions such as creating posts, commenting, and voting on posts.
6. **[Plants Vs Zombies with Tkinter](https://github.com/lai-kevin/PlantsVsZombiesParody):** A Tkinter desktop game developed while taking Carnegie Mellon's 15-112. This program pushes the rendering limits of Tkinter and was developed with the goal of learning about the capabilities of Tkinter.
